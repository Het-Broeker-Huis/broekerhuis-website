## A Village Where Time Slows Down
Broek in Waterland isn’t a place you rush through. It’s where you slow down. Where the cobblestones speak, and the water reflects silence. Just outside Amsterdam – but a world away.

Wooden houses in soft pastels, tranquil canals, and a village heartbeat that still beats quietly.
