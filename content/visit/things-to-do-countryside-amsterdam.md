You don’t need a tour guide to enjoy Broek in Waterland. Just good shoes or a bike.

### Wander the village

Cross wooden bridges. Peek into pastel gardens. Hear your own footsteps for the first time in days. Broek moves slow, and so will you.

### Bike the Waterland route  

Flat, scenic, and quiet. Ride past cows, dykes and tiny villages like Zuiderwoude and Ransdorp. Stop for an apple or a beer – and return to Broek with a sun-flushed face, muddy shoes and an appetite for dinner.

No tickets. No queues. Just go.

This isn’t a concept restaurant. It’s the village table.  

We cook over open fire, with local, seasonal ingredients and no frills. Come for house-baked bread, soups that warm you up, and fresh coffee from house-roasted coffee beans.

Locals eat here. So can you.

Too relaxed to leave? We get that. That’s why we’re opening our first guest suite this summer.

Think: soft beds, your own kitchen and a breakfast that’s more like a feast. Perfect for wedding guests, families or just a slow weekend away.

**From Amsterdam Central Station**:

Bus 312, 314 or 315 to Broek in Waterland (15 min). Better yet — rent a bike and enjoy one of the most beautiful rides in the Netherlands. No guide. No ticket. Just go. You can walk the entire village in 15 minutes — not that you would want to.

**Best days to visit:** weekdays from 10am to dinner. Evenings for sunset by the water.

**Bring:** good shoes. A curious mood. Appetite for good food and local treats

**Don’t** **bring:** a checklist. A rigid schedule. A rush. Expectations.

*Never want to leave again? We understand.*

Let Amsterdam wear the crown. Broek in Waterland wears the wool sweater, offers you tea and tells better stories.

You came for a quick break from the city.  You found something slower, warmer, closer. Something you didn’t even know you were looking for.

And it starts at **Het Broeker Huis. Your lunch stop. Dinner spot. Your village living room.**  

**Your reason to stay a little longer.**
