You don’t need a tour guide to enjoy Broek in Waterland. Just good shoes or a bike.

:br

 

### Wander the village

Cross wooden bridges. Peek into pastel gardens. Hear your own footsteps for the first time in days. Broek moves slow, and so will you.

:br

 

### Bike the Waterland route  

Flat, scenic, and quiet. Ride past cows, dykes and tiny villages like Zuiderwoude and Ransdorp. Stop for an apple or a beer – and return to Broek with a sun-flushed face, muddy shoes and an appetite for dinner.

No tickets. No queues. Just go.

This isn’t a concept restaurant. It’s the village table.  

We cook over open fire, with local, seasonal ingredients and no frills. Come for house-baked bread, soups that warm you up, and fresh coffee from house-roasted coffee beans.

Locals eat here. So can you.

Too relaxed to leave? We get that. That’s why we’re opening our first guest suite this summer.

Think: soft beds, your own kitchen and a breakfast that’s more like a feast. Perfect for wedding guests, families or just a slow weekend away.

**From Amsterdam Central Station**:

Bus 312, 314 or 315 to Broek in Waterland (15 min). Better yet — rent a bike and enjoy one of the most beautiful rides in the Netherlands. No guide. No ticket. Just go. You can walk the entire village in 15 minutes — not that you would want to.

**Best days to visit:** weekdays from 10am to dinner. Evenings for sunset by the water.

**Bring:** good shoes. A curious mood. Appetite for good food and local treats

**Don’t** **bring:** a checklist. A rigid schedule. A rush. Expectations.

*Never want to leave again? We understand.*

Let Amsterdam wear the crown. broek in Waterland wears the wool sweater, offers you tea and tells better stories.

You came for a quick break from the city.  You found something slower, warmer, closer. Something you didn’t even know you were looking for.

And it starts at Het Broeker Huis. Your lunch stop. Dinner spot. Your village living room.  

Your reason to stay a little longer.
